# ðŸ”’ OWASP ZAP Security Scan

This project demonstrates an automated security scan of a web application using **OWASP ZAP** and **GitHub Actions**.

## What we use

- **OWASP ZAP** â€” for baseline security scanning of web apps.
- **Docker** â€” to run the target application (Juice Shop) and ZAP scanner.
- **GitHub Actions** â€” to automate the scan on every push or pull request.
- **Artifact Upload** â€” the HTML report is saved as a downloadable artifact.

## How it works

1. The workflow runs on every push to `main` branch or on pull requests.
2. It starts the Juice Shop Docker container.
3. It runs the OWASP ZAP baseline scan against the application.
4. A report (`zap_report.html`) is generated and uploaded as an artifact.

## Download Report
